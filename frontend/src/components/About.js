            I'm <strong>Shubham Patra</strong>, a final-year B.Tech student at
            ITER, SOA University, specializing in Computer Science & Information
            Technology. I focus on full-stack web development and love solving
            real-world problems through clean, efficient, and scalable code.
          </p>
          <p>
            From building a real-time collaborative code editor to creating AI
            assistants like Nyx, I enjoy working on projects that are practical,
            creative, and impactful. I value logic over layout and simplicity
            over overengineering.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I'm working as a{" "}
            <strong>Full Stack Developer Intern</strong> at Kurators,
            collaborating on live production features and following Agile
            workflows. It's been a great opportunity to build scalable web apps
            and gain industry-level experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            I thrive in late-night coding sessions, powered by coffee. I'm
            constantly learning, building, and exploring new ideas â€” preferably
            in dark mode.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe in shipping fast, learning by doing, and writing code
            that's not just functional but also readable and maintainable. Clean
            architecture, meaningful variable names, and thoughtful
            problem-solving are core principles I follow.
          </p>

            I'm currently open to full-time software development opportunities
