### Media Queries Structure
```css
/* Standard approach for all components */
@media (max-width: var(--breakpoint-md)) { /* Tablets and below */ }
@media (max-width: var(--breakpoint-sm)) { /* Mobile phones */ }
@media (max-width: var(--breakpoint-xs)) { /* Very small phones */ }
```

### Touch Target Guidelines
- Minimum 44px for standard touch targets
- Minimum 48px for primary actions
- Adequate spacing between interactive elements

### Performance Optimizations

## Testing Recommendations

5. **Accessibility Testing**: Verify with screen readers and keyboard navigation

## Maintenance Notes
